== Automatic Registration ==
Some (all?) people may experience troubles installing Mapbook on 64 bit Windows XP systems. The fix is to download [http://arcmapbook.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Visual_Basic/register_component_category.reg  register_component_category.reg] from R95 or newer and put in the arcmapbook `Visual_Basic` folder, then run *`_install.bat`*

Note: on 32bit systems this will add 2 registry entries which will not be used. They should be harmless, but if you find differently please file an [http://code.google.com/p/arcmapbook/issues/list Issue].


== Manual Registration Procedure ==
_in case the above doesn't work_

  # Run the `Categories.exe` exectutable in you ArcGIS bin directory.
  # Scroll down to _ESRI Mx Extensions_ and select that category.
  # Click on the _Add Object ..._ button and browse for `DSMapBookUIPrj.dll`
  # When the Add Object dialog comes up, uncheck everything and then click on just `DSMapBookExt` and click OK.
  # While still in the Component Category Manager, scroll up to _ESRI Contents Views_ and select that category.
  # Click on the _Add Object ..._ button and again browse for `DSMapBookUIPrj.dll`
  # Uncheck all the classes, then click on just `DSMapBookTab` and click OK

Open and Run 32-bit Command Prompt in 64-bit (x64) Windows:

  # click start 
  # open run dialog and you type `%windir%\SysWoW64\cmd.exe` (or from search box type `%windir%\SysWoW64\cmd.exe`)
  # Press Enter
  # you test 32bit console (for instance `echo %programfiles%` you see `program files(x86)`)
  # move in the folder where you have an install.bat (for instance `cd %programfiles%\yourdll`) and from prompt type `install.bat` 
  # Press Enter

same for uninstall
