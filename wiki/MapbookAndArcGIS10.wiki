#summary what is the future of DS Mapbook?

  _I was just curious what plans, if any, you know of for DS Mapbook for ArcGIS 10?  We use it from time to time and wonder whether it will be a going concern._
  
  _Thanks for any info and the effort you've put into it._

DS Mapbook may continue to work in ArcGIS 10 (aka 9.4) but unlikely 
beyond that. v10 has it's own officially supported Mapbook feature set 
so this is the best place to focus efforts, see [http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//00s90000002s000000.htm Building map books with ArcGIS]

I'll continue to maintain these Arcmapbook project pages for as long as I 
can squirrel away the odd bit of time from my "real job". Perhaps it 
will grow to encompass v10 mapbooks as well, I won't know until I play 
with the new feature in depth.

cheers,

matt
