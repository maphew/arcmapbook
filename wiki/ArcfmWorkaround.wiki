#summary how to use ArcFM and Mapbook together

When ArcFM is installed the Map Series Tab in the table of contents panel isn't showing up and isn't available to check in the tools>options>table of contents dialog. The toolbar is there and all the buttons seem to work, just no tab.

The solution is to modify two .cls files and recompile the mapbook dlls. Please see issue#19 for details and dlls for download ([http://code.google.com/p/arcmapbook/issues/detail?id=19#c9 comment #9])
