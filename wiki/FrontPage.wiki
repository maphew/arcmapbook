_December 2007 - Someday, this will be an introduction to the Arcmapbook project and a guide to resources. Right now  we're in the process of migrating from arcmapbook.sourceforge.net here to google code._

== What's Where ==

Browse the [http://arcmapbook.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/ Docs folder].

Have a suggestion or bug report? See [http://code.google.com/p/arcmapbook/issues/list Issues]

As the user base here is still tiny if you're looking for help it is a good idea to look through the [http://support.esri.com/ ESRI Support Site], especially the [http://forums.esri.com/Forums.asp?c=93 desktop forums], as most people will post there first -- understandably enough!
