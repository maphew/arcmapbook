= Introduction =

_December 2007 - in the process of migrating from arcmapbook.sourceforge.net here to google code. Subversion code repository is complete, still to come are already filed Bugs & Enhancements._

== What's Where ==

Browse the [http://arcmapbook.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/ Docs folder] in svn. To contribute new docs, simply create a new wiki page.

Old tracker for bugs and feature enhancement requests: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=170350&atid=853944
The new one is under the _[http://code.google.com/p/arcmapbook/issues/list Issues]_ tab above.

It is a good idea to look through the [http://support.esri.com/ ESRI Support Site], especially the [http://forums.esri.com/Forums.asp?c=93 desktop forums], as most people will post there first -- understandably enough!
