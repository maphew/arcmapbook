Administrator rights are required for this solution.

 * Start >Control Panel >User Accounts > Turn User Account Control on or off
 * Uncheck - Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer
 * Restart computer

 * Install DS Map Book  (I verified that MapBook appeared in ArcMap.)
 * Go back in and turn UAC back on. (I verified that MapBook appeared in ArcMap.)
