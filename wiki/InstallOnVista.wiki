#Summary some workarounds for installing on Windows Vista

= Introduction =

Installation on Windows Vista is not yet reliably a straightfoward procedure. Some people have no troubles, others a lot. If you encounter difficulties here are some things you can try.

= Workarounds =

== Turn off User Account Control ==
Administrator rights are required for this solution.

 * Start >Control Panel >User Accounts > Turn User Account Control on or off
 * Uncheck - Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer
 * Restart computer

 * Install DS Map Book  (I verified that MapBook appeared in ArcMap.)
 * Go back in and turn UAC back on. (I verified that MapBook appeared in ArcMap.)

== Specify absolute path to regedit, regsrvr32 ==
Edit `_install.bat` and put the entire path for regsvr32 and regedit in the file. It 
was happy and worked. An updated `_install.bat` is available in r101.  

_See issue#40 for more details._

== Run CMD as Administrator _then_ `_install.bat` ==

Run the *command prompt* as an administrator (ie right click - then run as administrator) and *_then_ run the updated Install.bat*.
   
Running the Install.bat as an administrator from Windows does _not_ work (ie right
click Install.bat then run as administrator). This is the case even when actually logged on as an admin.
