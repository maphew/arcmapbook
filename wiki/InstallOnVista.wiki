#summary some workarounds for installing on Windows Vista & 7
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

Installation on Windows Vista and Windows 7 is not yet reliably a straightfoward procedure. Some people have no troubles, others a lot. If you encounter difficulties here are some things you can try.

= Workarounds =

== Run CMD as Administrator _then_ `_install.bat` ==

Run the *command prompt* as an administrator (ie right click - then run as administrator) and *_then_ run the updated Install.bat*.
   
Running the Install.bat as an administrator from Windows does _not_ work (ie right
click Install.bat then run as administrator). This is the case even when actually logged on as an admin.

_See issue#44 for background_

== Don't run `install.bat` from C: ==

Even with admin rights, the C: volume has some restrictions on what you can and can't do, and from where within the volume those restrictions are applied. Extract the mapbook archive to another drive if possible, or somewhere under your user folder, and run the install from there. 

_thanks to Colleen, in comments below_

== Turn off User Account Control ==
Administrator rights are required for this solution.

 * Start >Control Panel >User Accounts > Turn User Account Control on or off
 * Uncheck - Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer
 * Restart computer

 * Install DS Map Book  (I verified that MapBook appeared in ArcMap.)
 * Go back in and turn UAC back on. (I verified that MapBook appeared in ArcMap.)

== Specify absolute path to regedit, regsrvr32 ==
Edit `_install.bat` and put the entire path for regsvr32 and regedit in the file. It 
was happy and worked. An updated `_install.bat` is available in r101.  

_See issue#40 for more details._


== If "Map Series" toolbar not available try: ==

 * Tools > Customize > _Add from file_
 * Browse `path\to\mapbook\Visual_Basic` and select "DSMapBookUIPrj.dll"

"Map Series" should show up in the list of available toolbars.
