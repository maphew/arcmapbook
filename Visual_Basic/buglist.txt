

Absolute Path present in c_sModuleFileName:
===========================================

Remove all usage of c_sModuleFileName since this contains an absolute path to the module contents.



Permit an empty detail insets feature class
===========================================

Detail inset editing/creation tools fail when the bubble polygon layer is empty.
Fixed on 4-18-2006.


Layout element becomes permanently unavailable if set invisible on all map pages
================================================================================

	When making a layout element non-visible on all map pages, right click a map
page, select visible elements, and in the dialog choose to make that element visible
on that map page.  Result: element does not show up when you reload the map page.
Expected result: the element should have become available.  This layout element is
listed, but never becomes visible again.



Dataframe Extent updating interferes with Data Frame Visibility Control
=======================================================================

	When setting a data frame to not appear on a given map page, and also 
setting NW Mapbook to control the extent of that same data frame, the data frame
extent ceases to be updated after the data frame was made non-visible.



Dataframe Extent Update Settings not loaded in Series Properties Dialog.
========================================================================
	After setting a data frame other than the main data frame to be updated 
when map pages are loaded, those settings are lost from the interface the next 
time you open the series properties dialog.  As a result, if you click on the
[OK] button without reapplying your data frame extent settings, they are lost.
The load event of the series properties dialog needs to acquire previous data
frame extent updating settings.
