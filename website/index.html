<h1>ArcMapbook </h1>
<p><strong><img src="images/mapbook.png" width="112" height="52" hspace="10" border="0" align="left"> DS Mapbook</strong> is
  a developer sample for <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/about/desktop.html#desktop_apps">ESRI's
    ArcMap</a> which simplifies the generation of map series. Mapbook allows
      the creation of multiple maps from a single ArcMap .mxd file. Map series
      can be tiled like USGS or NTS quadrangles, discontinuous (e.g. lakes of
  the Yukon), or in strips (e.g. following a road). The best introduction to
  its
      features is <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0702/dsmapbook1of2.html">ArcGIS
      Software Simplifies Map Book Generation</a> from the summer 2002 issue
      of <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/index.html">Arc
      User Online</a>. The link to the sample in that article is for v8.3. For
      v9.2, you want to go to <a href="http://edndoc.esri.com/arcobjects/9.2/CPP_VB6_VBA_VCPP_Doc/COM_Samples_Docs/Cartography/Map_Production/DSMapBook/9d2dafa6-fcae-4e3d-bd27-1f242b216452.htm">ArcObjects
    Online</a>.</p>
<p>The <em><strong><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/arcmapbook/">ArcMap
        Mapbook Project</a></strong></em> shortname arcmapbook, (this site) is
        an open source and volunteer effort to extend, enhance, and fix the bugs
        in the developer sample. The project itself is still in it's early stages.
        All we've accomplished to this point is to put the code for the last
        four releases into a <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/arcmapbook/">version
        control repository</a> (svn) and collect some ideas of the first set
        of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=170350&atid=853944">bugs
and enhancements</a> to tackle. </p>

      <p>Browse the <a href="http://arcmapbook.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/arcmapbook/trunk/docs/">Docs
          folder in svn</a>, click on the number in the &quot;<em>Rev.</em>&quot; column
          to download.</p>
      <h3>Discussion and Support</h3>
      <p>There is a FORUM for general discussion, help, and fleshing out of ideas:<a href="http://arcmapbook.sourceforge.net/forum/"> http://arcmapbook.sourceforge.net/forum/</a>,</p>
      <p>A TRACKER for bugs and feature enhancement requests: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=170350&atid=853944">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=170350&amp;atid=853944</a>,</p>
      <p>And a WIKI for well considered ideas, enhanced documentation, and reference
        material. It is the staging ground for what will eventually become the
        documentation distributed with the download package: <a href="http://arcmapbook.wiki.sourceforge.net/">http://arcmapbook.wiki.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
      <p>It is a good idea to look through the <a href="http://support.esri.com/">ESRI
          Support Site</a>, especially the <a href="http://forums.esri.com/Forums.asp?c=93">desktop
          forum</a>s, as most people will post there first -- understandably

      <h3>Release_9.2_2007.October.26</h3>
      <p><font size="-1"><a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/arcmapbook/Mapbook_for_9.2_2007.October.26.zip" class="download">[Download]</a></font> The
        main reason for this release is to bundle the slightly improved un/install
      with the main code. Changes from March release are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> improved installation and removal usability (moved un/install.bat
          to top folder)</li>
        <li> initial check-in of <a href="http://forums.esri.com/Thread.asp?c=93&f=989&t=64703&mc=373#706998">Jerry
            Chase's customisation</a> of Mapbook <em>(<a href="http://arcmapbook.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/arcmapbook/branches/v9.2_chase/docs/Customized%20DS%20Map%20Book%20Manual.doc">Customized
        DS Map Book Manual.doc</a>)</em>. NOTE: actual code is not yet implemented in
        arcmapbook, you'll have to pull it out of the doc yourself. Jerry's doc
        includes instruction and code. Outline of added functionality: 1. The
        ability to control the extent of the locator frames: a. Scaled Indicator:
        scale by the percentage of area of the record in focus b. Scaled Local
        Indicator: scaled by the percentage of the area which includes the record
        in focus and all records contiguous to it c. Index 2 Indicator: the ability
        to control extent of indicator frame by the area of a secondary index
        which is tied to the index of the record in focus (State in which a county
        is located). </li>
        <li> Added to pause to (un)install batch files so any error messages
        can be seen. _UNINSTALL.bat now deletes Mapbook registry keys</li>
      </ul>      <p>If you are currently using DS Mapbook from the 9.2 developer sample
        kit, you should upgrade to this release. </p>
      <p>If you've already installed the March-13 version from the ESRI support
        forum, ignore the 'Visual_Basic' folder, the only value added stuff this
        package is the documentation.</p>
      <p> For older releases see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=170350">Downloads</a> on
    the Sourceforge project page.</p></td>

<h2>About</h2>
<p><em>So who's running the project?</em></p>
<p><em>Matt Wilkie</em> - project and website administrator. Matt is not a developer
  though he has been known from time to time to program his way out of a (very
  wet) paper bag.</p>
<p><em>Aubrey Sicotte</em> - has more developer smarts than Matt, having actually
  gone to school, but still getting his feet wet in ArcMap VBA.</p>
<h4>Contributors</h4>
<ul>
  <li><em>Nathan Shephard, Melanie Baker, and Larry Young</em> of ESRI - the
    original authors of DS Mapbook</li>
  <li> <em>Julie Houle</em> of Yukon Energy Mines &amp; Resources - brought to
    attention code to allow Map Rotation for individual maps in the series (v9.1),
    original author unknown</li>
  <li> <em>DuaneWilkins</em> from New Zealand - documentation: &quot;Quick Guide
    to Map Series Maker&quot;<br>

<p>The ArcMap Mapbook Project is an independant endeavour and not sponsored or
  endorsed by <a href="http://www.esri.com/">ESRI, </a>although
it is built on code developed by them and put out for distribution. Thank you
