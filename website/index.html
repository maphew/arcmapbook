<h1>A Mapbook for ArcMap</h1>
<p><strong>DS MapBook</strong> is a developer sample for <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/about/desktop.html#desktop_apps">ESRI's
  ArcMap</a> which simplifies
  the
generation of map series. MapBook allows the creation of multiple
  maps  from a single ArcMap .mxd file. Map series can be tiled like USGS
  or NTS quadrangles, discontinuous (e.g. lakes of the Yukon), or in strips (e.g.
following a road).  The best introduction to its features
    is <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0702/dsmapbook1of2.html">ArcGIS
    Software Simplifies Map Book Generation</a> from the summer 2002 issue
    of <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/index.html">Arc User Online</a>.
    The link to the sample in that article is for v8.3. For v9.2, you want to
    go to <a href="http://edndoc.esri.com/arcobjects/9.2/CPP_VB6_VBA_VCPP_Doc/COM_Samples_Docs/Cartography/Map_Production/DSMapBook/9d2dafa6-fcae-4e3d-bd27-1f242b216452.htm">ArcObjects
    Online</a>.</p>

<p>The <em><strong>Map Book Project</strong></em> (this site) is an open source
  and volunteer effort to extend, enhance, and fix the bugs in the developer
  sample. The project itself is still in it's early stages. All we've accomplished
  to
  this
  point
  is to put the code for the last four releases into a <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/esri-mapbook/">version
  control repository</a> (svn) and collect some ideas of the first set of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=170350&atid=853944">bugs
and enhancements</a> to tackle. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.spatialanalyst.net.ms">Duane Wilkins in New Zealand</a> has
  also put together a <em><a href="http://www.hnpl.net/dwilkins/downloads/QuickguidetoMapSeriesMaker.pdf">Quick
  Guide to Map Series Maker</a></em> (pdf 1.8mb) and graciously contributed it
  to the project, <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/esri-mapbook/trunk/docs/">now
in svn.</a></p>
<p>Significant milestones in svn are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://esri-mapbook.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/esri-mapbook/tags/Release_8.3/">Release
      8.3</a>, as the name implies this for use with ArcMap 8.3. Please note
      the &quot;not for commercial use&quot; license clause.</li>
  <li><a href="http://esri-mapbook.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/esri-mapbook/tags/Release_9.0/">Release
      9.0</a>, for use with ArcMap 9.0. This is the first release where the not
      for commercial use clause is lifted.</li>
  <li><a href="http://esri-mapbook.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/esri-mapbook/tags/Release_9.1/">Release
  9.1</a>, for use  with ArcMap 9.1</li>
  <li><em>Release 9.2 forthcoming</em>, it's in svn as <a href="http://esri-mapbook.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/esri-mapbook/trunk/">trunk</a> but
    not yet tagged as a release. Still some testing to do to make sure it works
    with ArcMap 9.2 and integrate the small enhancements which have been contributed.
    There is another license change, relatively minor, asking that the original
    copyright and restrictions always be distributed along with all changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Map Book Project is an independant endeavour and not endorsed by <a href="http://www.esri.com/">ESRI, </a>although
  it is built on code developed by them and put out for distribution.</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p><em>So who's running the project?</em></p>
<p><em>Matt Wilkie</em> - project and website administrator.
  Matt is not a developer though he has been known from time to time to program
  his
  way
  out
  of a (very
  wet) paper bag.</p>
<p><em>Aubrey Sicotte</em> - has more developer smarts than
  Matt, having actually gone to school, but still getting his feet wet in ArcMap
  VBA.</p>
<h4>Contributors</h4>
<ul>
  <li><em>Nathan Shephard, Melanie Baker, and Larry Young</em> of ESRI - the original
  authors of DS Mapbook</li>
  <li>    <em>Julie Houle</em> of Yukon Energy Mines &amp; Resources
    - brought to  attention code to allow Map Rotation for individual maps
    in the series
  (v9.1), original author unknown</li>
  <li>    <em>DuaneWilkins</em> from New Zealand - documentation:
    &quot;Quick
