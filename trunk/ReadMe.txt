Mapbook for ArcMap 9.2, Release 9.2 2007 March 13

This release is a wholesale merge of Larry Young's upstream release of 
2007-March-13[*] with our local documents. From Larry's comments, there are a lot 
of fixes to the Export routines.

Almost every file had dozens of changes, though >90% are just line prefixes (e.g. 
73:... to 86:...). so I probably missed things.

If you are currently using DS Mapbook from the 9.2 developer sample kit, you 
should upgrade to this release. 

If you've already installed the March-13 version from the ESRI support forum, 
ignore the 'Visual_Basic' folder, the only value added stuff this package is the 
documentation.
