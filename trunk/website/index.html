<h1>ArcMapbook</h1>
<p><strong>DS Mapbook</strong> is a developer sample for <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/about/desktop.html#desktop_apps">ESRI's
    ArcMap</a> which simplifies the generation of map series. Mapbook allows
      the creation of multiple maps from a single ArcMap .mxd file. Map series
      can be tiled like USGS or NTS quadrangles, discontinuous (e.g. lakes of
  the Yukon), or in strips (e.g. following a road). The best introduction to
  its
      features is <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0702/dsmapbook1of2.html">ArcGIS
      Software Simplifies Map Book Generation</a> from the summer 2002 issue
      of <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/index.html">Arc
      User Online</a>. The link to the sample in that article is for v8.3. For
      v9.2, you want to go to <a href="http://edndoc.esri.com/arcobjects/9.2/CPP_VB6_VBA_VCPP_Doc/COM_Samples_Docs/Cartography/Map_Production/DSMapBook/9d2dafa6-fcae-4e3d-bd27-1f242b216452.htm">ArcObjects
    Online</a>.</p>

<p>The <em><strong><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/arcmapbook/">ArcMap
        Mapbook Project</a></strong></em> shortname arcmapbook, (this site) is
        an open source and volunteer effort to extend, enhance, and fix the bugs
        in the
        developer
        sample.
        The project itself is still in it's early stages. All we've accomplished
        to this point is to put the code for the last four releases into a <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/arcmapbook/">version
        control repository</a> (svn) and collect some ideas of the first set
        of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=170350&atid=853944">bugs
        and enhancements</a> to tackle. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.spatialanalyst.net.ms">Duane Wilkins in New Zealand</a> has
  also put together a <em><a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/arcmapbook/trunk/docs/QuickguidetoMapSeriesMaker.pdf">Quick
  Guide to Map Series Maker</a></em> (pdf 1.8mb) and graciously contributed it
  to the project, <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/arcmapbook/trunk/docs/">now
  in svn.</a></p>
<h3>Mapbook
for ArcMap 9.2, Release_9.2_2007.March.13</h3>
<p><font size="-1"><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=170350" class="download">[Download]</a></font> This
  release is a wholesale merge of <a href="http://forums.esri.com/Thread.asp?c=93&f=989&t=211395#653249">Larry
    Young's upstream release of 2007-March-13</a> with our local documents.
    From Larry's comments, there are a lot 
of fixes to the Export routines. Almost every file had dozens of changes, though &gt;90%
are just line prefixes (e.g. 
73:... to 86:...). so I (Matt) probably missed things.</p>
<p>If you are currently using DS Mapbook from the 9.2 developer sample kit, you
  should upgrade to this release. </p>
<p>If you've already installed the March-13 version from the ESRI support forum,
  ignore the 'Visual_Basic' folder, the only value added stuff this package is
    the 
  documentation.</p>
<p>	For
  older releases see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=170350">Downloads</a> on
  the Sourceforge project page.</p>
<h3>Discussion  and Support</h3>
<p>There is a FORUM for general discussion, help, and fleshing out of ideas:<a href="http://arcmapbook.sourceforge.net/forum/"> http://arcmapbook.sourceforge.net/forum/</a>,</p>
<p>A TRACKER for bugs and feature enhancement requests: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=170350&atid=853944">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=170350&amp;atid=853944</a>,</p>
<p>And a WIKI for well considered ideas, enhanced documentation, and reference
  material. It is the staging ground for what will eventually become the documentation
  distributed with the download package. Please put some time aside to think
  about what you want to say before posting here: <a href="http://arcmapbook.wiki.sourceforge.net/">http://arcmapbook.wiki.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<p>It is a good idea to
  look through the <a href="http://support.esri.com/">ESRI Support Site</a>,
  especially the <a href="http://forums.esri.com/Forums.asp?c=93">desktop forum</a>s,
  as most people will post there first -- understandably enough!</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p><em>So who's running the project?</em></p>
<p><em>Matt Wilkie</em> - project and website administrator. Matt is not a developer
  though he has been known from time to time to program his way out of a (very
  wet) paper bag.</p>
<p><em>Aubrey Sicotte</em> - has more developer smarts than Matt, having actually
  gone to school, but still getting his feet wet in ArcMap VBA.</p>
<h4>Contributors</h4>
<ul>
  <li><em>Nathan Shephard, Melanie Baker, and Larry Young</em> of ESRI - the
    original authors of DS Mapbook</li>
  <li> <em>Julie Houle</em> of Yukon Energy Mines &amp; Resources - brought to
    attention code to allow Map Rotation for individual maps in the series (v9.1),
    original author unknown</li>
  <li> <em>DuaneWilkins</em> from New Zealand - documentation: &quot;Quick Guide
    to Map Series Maker&quot;<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The ArcMap Mapbook Project is an independant endeavour and not sponsored or
  endorsed by <a href="http://www.esri.com/">ESRI, </a>although
it is built on code developed by them and put out for distribution. Thank you
